// If the player with cards left deals all their cards into the center without revealing a Jack,
// the central pile returns to that playerâ€™s hand, is shuffled, and the player must continue to deal until a Jack is revealed
// When a Jack is revealed, the player who is out of cards can slap it.
// The central pile is then their new hand, the game continues as normal.
// If however, the player who is out of cards slaps something that is not a Jack,
// or if the player who still has cards slaps the Jack first, then the player who is out of cards loses and the game is over!
// Doubles and Sandwiches are not valid when one player is completely out of cards - in this case, only a Jack can save them!
// The only way the player who still has cards can win is by slapping the Jack before the player without cards left does
